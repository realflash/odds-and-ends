odds-and-ends
=============

A few scripts I wanted to make public. The following things are in here:

* librealflash1 - An OpenSCAD library used by some of my designs on Thingiverse
* librealflash2 - An OpenSCAD library used by some of my designs on Thingiverse
* Python Dumper - A python equivalent to perl's Dump::Dumper
* FogBugz to Pivotal Tracker - A script I wrote to migrate our issues list from FB to PT
* FC Loan Hider - A greasemonkey script that allows you to hide crappy loans on Funding Circle so you don't read them again later
* FC Loan RSS - A node.js app to let you know when new loans meeting your criteria come on to the secondary market
